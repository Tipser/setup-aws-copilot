# Setup AWS Copilot

> 👩‍✈️A GitHub Action for setting up the [AWS Copilot command line interface](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli)

## fork info

This is Tipsre for of `softprops/setup-aws-copilot`. Intial reason was to have udpated dependencies. Outdated one caused the action to fail. Second reason, that popped up later on is to switch to Tipser fork of `copilot-cli` -> https://github.com/Tipser/copilot-cli.

## usage

```
